# Finetuning_LLM

Efficiently adapt language models for financial advising with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). This project showcases the application of PEFT techniques to a pre-trained language model, achieving cost-effective adaptation for the finance sector. Achieve competitive performance while fine-tuning only a fraction of the model's parameters. Explore the future of contextually relevant content generation in finance.
